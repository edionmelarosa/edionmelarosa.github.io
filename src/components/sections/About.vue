    <section id="about">
        <p>Currently, working with SandboxDigital as Web Developer and SysAdmin.
            I have been doing Web Development (little of  Mobile with MeteorJs)
            for about 5 years since college.
            When not coding, I do mountain climbing and cycling with friends,
            this has been my stress reliever.
